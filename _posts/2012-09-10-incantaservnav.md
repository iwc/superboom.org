# Incanta Service Navigator #

The Service Navigator was an Internet Explorer Tool Band (a sidebar) for use as a launchpad for ISP customers that would be constantly available regardless of the user's browser location. The contents of the Service Navigator sidebar included a fully functional ActiveX version of the Incanta Music playback engine. The ActiveX player was completely driven via Javascript in the HTML content of the sidebar. My work included the initial prototyping of the sidebar addon functionality, and development of the ActiveX wrapper and scripting interface.
