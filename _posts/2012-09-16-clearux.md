# Clear UX Framework #

The ClearUX Framework facilitates rapid web application development. Server side handlers process declarative UI specs and generate a web UI based on the [Ext.js](http://sencha.com) Javascript library. ClearUX is intended for front ends for Infor's Enterprise applications, to provide a consitent user experience across applications. Most widgets are focused on presentation of large datasets in a clean, simple design.
