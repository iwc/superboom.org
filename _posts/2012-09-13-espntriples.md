#ESPN Screening Support System (Triple S)#

The ESPN Screening Support System was a custom application extension to the BBC Colledia digital video broadcast package. The Screening Support System provided an interface to production assistants (screeners) to view and rapidly tag video clips with metadata tied to specific timecodes in the video. Screeners could tag the ins and outs of interesting video segments, tag and label those segments with relevant descriptions, then export an Edit Decision List to a full Colledia digital video editing suite to refine the rough cuts into full video packages. Production assistants could use the Triple S system to build tease/bump segments around commecial breaks, or build clips for news stories for broadcast on ESPN SportsCenter. My work included reviewing UI design requirements with our requirements gathering staff, the chief UX designer, and ESPN executives. I led a small development team to implement the Triple S user interface. I prototyped several core components, such as a docking window framework. I worked with the middleware team to establish UI integration with the rest of the Colledia backend. The Triple S UI development was implemented with COM, ATL and WTL.
