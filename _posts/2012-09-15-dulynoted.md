# DulyNoted#

DulyNoted is my first foray into iPhone application development. I was really displeased with using the built in Notes application for tracking to-do lists. DulyNoted is a lightweight to-do list/note application that allows you to add/delete/reorder notes on the fly and add details for completing your goal. You can also take photos and attach them to notes, or attach an already existing image from your camera roll.
