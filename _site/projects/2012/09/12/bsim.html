<h1 id='bellsouth_instant_messenger__att_instant_messenger'>Bellsouth Instant Messenger / AT&amp;T Instant Messenger</h1>

<p>The Bellsouth Messenger was part of a suite of internet applications for Bellsouth.net ISP customers. The Bellsouth Messenger provided a integrated Instant Messaging solution that used Jabber/XMPP for it&#8217;s internal IM protocol. In addition to Jabber support, it included client side protocol support for MSN, Yahoo, and AOL IM networks. The Bellsouth Messenger application also integrated with an Address Book and Email client. The entire suite was architected as a collection of reusable COM components. My work included general UI development, development of COM infrastructure, implementation of the MSN Messenger support, and implementation of major parts of the chat window. The chat window used the IE webbrowser control for display and editing of chat messages with rich formatting. In a later phase of the project, I did early work on some of the UI support to provide the Photo sharing feature.</p>
