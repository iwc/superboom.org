<p>The ClearUX Framework facilitates rapid web application development. Server side handlers process declarative UI specs and generate a web UI based on the <a href='http://sencha.com'>Ext.js</a> Javascript library. ClearUX is intended for front ends for Infor&#8217;s Enterprise applications, to provide a consitent user experience across applications. Most widgets are focused on presentation of large datasets in a clean, simple design.</p>
