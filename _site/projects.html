      <h1>Projects</h1>
Here are some selected projects that I have worked on:


 
 <div class="well well-large">
 	<h1 id='clear_ux_framework'>Clear UX Framework</h1>

<p>The ClearUX Framework facilitates rapid web application development. Server side handlers process declarative UI specs and generate a web UI based on the <a href='http://sencha.com'>Ext.js</a> Javascript library. ClearUX is intended for front ends for Infor&#8217;s Enterprise applications, to provide a consitent user experience across applications. Most widgets are focused on presentation of large datasets in a clean, simple design.</p>

 	<h1 id='dulynoted'>DulyNoted</h1>

<p>DulyNoted is my first foray into iPhone application development. I was really displeased with using the built in Notes application for tracking to-do lists. DulyNoted is a lightweight to-do list/note application that allows you to add/delete/reorder notes on the fly and add details for completing your goal. You can also take photos and attach them to notes, or attach an already existing image from your camera roll.</p>

 </div>
 

 
 <div class="well well-large">
 	<h1 id='yahoo_toolbar'>Yahoo! Toolbar</h1>

<p>The Yahoo! Toolbar is fairly well known throughout most of the world, shipping in over 30 countries. I developed features and infrastructure for Yahoo! Toolbar for Internet Explorer from version 6 through version 8. I developed client features, such as RSS feed buttons, early prototypes of tabbed browsing support for IE5 and IE6 (which lacked tabs), and the Welcome Page and Event Tips contextual popups. I developed Accessibility support for the Toolbar client using Microsoft Active Accessibility. For Toolbar 8, I implemented major client pieces of the My Notifications feature, which provides always present visibility of activities from the Yahoo! Updates social network. In addition these client features, I also developed server-side services for use by the Toolbar in PHP, and editing tools to create new buttons and other client features using the Toolbar&#8217;s dynamic button infrastructure. I did extensive work on both client and server side components to support a shift from native codepage based text data to using UTF-8 systemwide, which supports the active international user base.</p>

 <div class="well well-large">
 	<h1 id='espn_screening_support_system_triple_s'>ESPN Screening Support System (Triple S)</h1>

<p>The ESPN Screening Support System was a custom application extension to the BBC Colledia digital video broadcast package. The Screening Support System provided an interface to production assistants (screeners) to view and rapidly tag video clips with metadata tied to specific timecodes in the video. Screeners could tag the ins and outs of interesting video segments, tag and label those segments with relevant descriptions, then export an Edit Decision List to a full Colledia digital video editing suite to refine the rough cuts into full video packages. Production assistants could use the Triple S system to build tease/bump segments around commecial breaks, or build clips for news stories for broadcast on ESPN SportsCenter. My work included reviewing UI design requirements with our requirements gathering staff, the chief UX designer, and ESPN executives. I led a small development team to implement the Triple S user interface. I prototyped several core components, such as a docking window framework. I worked with the middleware team to establish UI integration with the rest of the Colledia backend. The Triple S UI development was implemented with COM, ATL and WTL.</p>

 <div class="well well-large">
 	<h1 id='bellsouth_instant_messenger__att_instant_messenger'>Bellsouth Instant Messenger / AT&amp;T Instant Messenger</h1>

<p>The Bellsouth Messenger was part of a suite of internet applications for Bellsouth.net ISP customers. The Bellsouth Messenger provided a integrated Instant Messaging solution that used Jabber/XMPP for it&#8217;s internal IM protocol. In addition to Jabber support, it included client side protocol support for MSN, Yahoo, and AOL IM networks. The Bellsouth Messenger application also integrated with an Address Book and Email client. The entire suite was architected as a collection of reusable COM components. My work included general UI development, development of COM infrastructure, implementation of the MSN Messenger support, and implementation of major parts of the chat window. The chat window used the IE webbrowser control for display and editing of chat messages with rich formatting. In a later phase of the project, I did early work on some of the UI support to provide the Photo sharing feature.</p>

 <div class="well well-large">
 	<h1 id='incanta_music'>Incanta Music</h1>

<p>Incanta Music was a Windows client application that enabled users to listen to a personalized internet radio station. Incanta Music allowed users to rank their preference of various music generes, artists, and even individual songs to create a personally relevant music experience. Based on your rankings, the Incanta Music server would select tracks you like, plus tracks you had not heard before, but were likes of other users with similar tastes. The functionality was not unlike services like Pandora or Last.fm, but Incanta Music was available to Broadband ISP customers in 1999. My primary focus on this project was the client user interface, sending user ranking feedback up to the servers via our middleware library, and managing the MPEG audio data on the client side that our middleware delivered.</p>
 </div>
 

 
 <div class="well well-large">
 	<h1 id='incanta_service_navigator'>Incanta Service Navigator</h1>

<p>The Service Navigator was an Internet Explorer Tool Band (a sidebar) for use as a launchpad for ISP customers that would be constantly available regardless of the user&#8217;s browser location. The contents of the Service Navigator sidebar included a fully functional ActiveX version of the Incanta Music playback engine. The ActiveX player was completely driven via Javascript in the HTML content of the sidebar. My work included the initial prototyping of the sidebar addon functionality, and development of the ActiveX wrapper and scripting interface.</p>
